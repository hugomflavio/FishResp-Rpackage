# Welcome

pyroresp is still in embryonic stage. This package was originally forked from the FishResp R package (https://github.com/embedded-sergey/FishResp-Rpackage) and has since grown to become a sibling of FishResp.

pyroresp focuses on using pyroscience output to run intermittent-flow respirometry analyses.
